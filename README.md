- Removing the frameborder fixed the problem.

### Validator Testing
 - HTML
   * No errors where found when passing through the official W3C validator, however I did have warning's, this was due to lack of headings in some sections which advises to use a div element instead if a heading is not needed which I have done.
 - CSS
   * No errors where found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator
 - Accessibility 
   * I can confirm that the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible by using the lighthouse in devtools.
